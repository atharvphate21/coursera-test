		"It is not the critic who counts;not the man who points out how the strong man stubles ,or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.The credit belong to the man who is actually in the arena,whose face is marred by the dust and sweet and blood ;who strives valiantly; who errs ,who con=me shorrt again and again,because their is no no efforts without error and short coming ;but who does actually strive to do the deeds ;who knows the greater enthusiasms, the great devotions;who spend himself in a worthy cause ;who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievment,and who at worst ,if he fails ,at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory&nbso;nor&nbso;defeat."
